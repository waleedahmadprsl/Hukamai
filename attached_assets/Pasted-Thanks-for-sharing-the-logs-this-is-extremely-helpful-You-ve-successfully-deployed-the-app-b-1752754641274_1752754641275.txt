Thanks for sharing the logs — this is **extremely helpful**. You’ve successfully deployed the app, but here’s the **root issue**:

---

## ❌ Root Error

```bash
Error: connect ETIMEDOUT 35.227.164.209:443
```

You're hitting a **network timeout** when your backend tries to connect to the Neon PostgreSQL database via WebSocket:

```bash
wss://dpg-d1qf0q3uibrs73elds00-a.oregon-postgres.render.com/v2
```

---

## 🧠 What’s Happening?

Your app is using the **Neon Serverless driver**, which connects to the database via **WebSockets** (wss).
But **Render's free tier** often **blocks or times out WebSocket outbound connections** — or the network latency is just high, especially to external DBs like Neon.

---

## ✅ Solution Options

---

### ✅ Option 1: **Switch to Neon’s HTTPS Connection**

If you're using the Neon Serverless client like:

```ts
import { Pool } from "@neondatabase/serverless";
const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL });
```

**Change it** to Neon’s HTTP-based driver OR switch to standard `pg` driver if WebSockets are unreliable.

---

### ✅ Option 2: **Use Standard `pg` Driver**

Instead of the WebSocket client (`@neondatabase/serverless`), switch to:

```bash
npm install pg
```

Then update your connection code to:

```ts
import { Pool } from 'pg';

const pool = new Pool({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  ssl: {
    rejectUnauthorized: false, // for Neon
  }
});
```

That avoids WebSockets entirely and works better on platforms like Render.

---

### ✅ Option 3: **Check Render Network Settings (Pro plan)**

If you are on Render’s **free tier**, outbound WebSocket reliability is limited.

To use Neon Serverless reliably:

* Use **Render Pro plan** (where outbound socket traffic is more stable)
* OR **host the database on Render** (e.g. PostgreSQL addon)

---

### ✅ Bonus: Add Error Handling

Add this in your DB init file so failures don't crash the entire server:

```ts
pool.connect().catch(err => {
  console.error('❌ Failed to connect to DB:', err.message);
});
```

---

## 🧪 Quick Fix to Try

1. Switch from `@neondatabase/serverless` to `pg`
2. Update connection string if needed
3. Redeploy

Let me know if you'd like the updated DB connection code or `.env` structure!
